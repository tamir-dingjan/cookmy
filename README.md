# CookMy

This is a personal project for Boot.Dev. I decided on a CLI tool for suggesting a recipe given a number of ingredients.

## Implementation

This tool uses the Spoonacular API to search for recipes which contain the user's inputted ingredients.


## Feature tracking

Currently implemented:
 - Recipe searching by ingredients
 - Retrieval of nutrition data
 - Terminal UI

To be added next:
 - Recipe saving into a local database to build a diet plan
